# Automated Email Assistant

## Overview

The **Automated Email Assistant** is a Python-based application that interacts with email accounts (e.g., Gmail) to automate email-related tasks, such as sending, receiving, and scheduling emails. The assistant can also handle attachments, auto-replies, and read unread emails. It supports OAuth2 authentication for secure email access and can be extended to include AI-based features such as automatic replies.

## Features

- **Send Emails**: Send emails with or without attachments.
- **Read Emails**: Read and process incoming emails.
- **Auto Reply**: Automatically reply to emails based on predefined templates.
- **Email Scheduling**: Schedule emails to be sent at a later time.
- **Attachment Handling**: Send and receive email attachments.
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure authentication with Gmail using OAuth2.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Track and log errors during email interactions.
- **Unread Email Fetching**: Filter and read only unread emails.
- **Backup Emails**: Option to save received emails to local files or cloud storage.

- `smtplib` (for sending emails)
- `imaplib` (for reading emails)
- `email` (for composing and parsing emails)
- `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-api-python-client` (for OAuth2 authentication and Gmail API interaction)
- `logging` (for error tracking)

Install the required dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
