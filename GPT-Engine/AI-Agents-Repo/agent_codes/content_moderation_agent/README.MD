Content Moderation Agent
The Content Moderation Agent is a Python-based tool that helps automate the process of moderating user-generated content. It performs the following tasks:

Detects profanity in text using the profanity_check library.
Analyzes the sentiment of the text (positive, negative, neutral) using TextBlob.
Tokenizes the text and removes stopwords using the nltk library.
Logs moderated content into an SQLite database for tracking purposes.
Sends email alerts to administrators if profane content is detected.
This tool can be integrated into web applications, social media platforms, or any content management system to ensure content complies with community guidelines.

Features
1. Profanity Detection
Detects offensive language in text using machine learning models from the profanity_check library.

2. Sentiment Analysis
Uses TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of content and categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral.

3. Tokenization and Stopword Removal
Uses nltk to tokenize the text and remove common stopwords, making the text more suitable for analysis.

4. Database Integration (SQLite)
Logs each piece of moderated content into an SQLite database (moderation_logs.db). The logs contain information about the content, detected profanity, and sentiment.

5. Email Alerts
Sends an email to an administrator if profane content is detected. The email includes the flagged content for review.

6. Real-Time Moderation
This agent can be used to moderate content in real-time by integrating it with a web service, social media platform, or API.
