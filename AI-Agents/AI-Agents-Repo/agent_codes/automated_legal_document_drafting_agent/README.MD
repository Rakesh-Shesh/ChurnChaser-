Complex Automated Legal Document Drafting Agent
This project presents a Complex Automated Legal Document Drafting Agent that utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process legal documents, identify important legal terms, named entities, and keywords, generate summaries, and even create new legal clauses based on the document's content. The agent also supports document visualization for legal entities using spaCy's displaCy tool.

Features
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Detects legal entities such as defendant, plaintiff, court names, laws, and legal references.
Legal Term Frequency Analysis: Counts the frequency of predefined legal terms within the document.
Keyword Extraction: Extracts the most relevant keywords using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Legal Citation Extraction: Extracts references to legal citations such as case law or statutes.
Automatic Legal Clause Generation: Generates legal clauses based on detected keywords or terms.
Document Summarization: Generates a comprehensive summary of the legal document, including the frequency of legal terms, recognized entities, citations, and keywords.
Entity Visualization: Visualizes named entities in the document using spaCy's displaCy tool.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
spaCy: For Named Entity Recognition (NER) and entity visualization
NLTK: For tokenization and text processing
scikit-learn: For TF-IDF keyword extraction
You can install the required libraries using the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install spacy nltk scikit-learn
Additionally, you need to download the spaCy model for NER:

bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
How It Works
Load the Document: Load a legal document (text file) from the specified path.
Process the Document:
Tokenize the text to extract words and sentences.
Analyze the frequency of predefined legal terms.
Use spaCy's Named Entity Recognition to identify legal entities such as defendant, plaintiff, court, etc.
Extract keywords from the document using TF-IDF.
Generate Summary:
Create a comprehensive summary of the document, including the legal term count, entity count, citations, and identified keywords.
Generate Legal Clauses:
Based on the keywords detected in the document, generate basic legal clauses for a contract or agreement.
Visualize Entities:
Use spaCy's displaCy tool to visualize the named entities within the document.
